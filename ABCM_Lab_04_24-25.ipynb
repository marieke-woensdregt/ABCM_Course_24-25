(2022) (see **Initialization** paragraph), each agent in the population has a language representation that consists of ```n_concepts``` concepts, where each concept is associated with (i) a set of culturally salient features, and (ii) a form. The set of culturally salient features and the form both consist of ```n_bits``` bits. (Also see Figure 4 in the paper.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector of culturally salient features represents the _meaning_ of the concept to the agent (which depends on their cultural background; i.e., the group they belong to). The form vector represents the _form_ (i.e., signal) that the agent would use in order to convey that concept.\n",
    "The parameter ```initial_degree_of_overlap``` determines the degree of overlap between the culturally salient features vector and the form. If this degree of overlap is high, that simulates a form that is highly _iconic_ (i.e., when aspects of the form resemble aspects of the meaning).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this section takes care of initialising the population and each agent's language representations, depending on which group in the population they belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done using the following four functions:\n",
    "- ```language_skeleton()```: Creates an empty language representation for an agent (where the meaning and form components are initialised with the value ```None```)\n",
    "- ```language_create_meanings()```: Randomly generates a bit vector of culturally-salient features for each concept, for each group in the population\n",
    "- ```language_add_meaning()```: Takes a particular agent object, and fills in the meaning vectors in its empty language representation with the bit vectors of culturally-salient features that correspond to the group that the agent belongs to\n",
    "- ```language_add_form()```: Takes a particular agent object, and fills in the form vectors in its empty language representation, depending on the setting of the ```initial_degree_of_overlap``` parameter, which determines the probability that a given bit of a meaning and form representation are the same (i.e., have the same value at the same index).

    "## Running a language game and updating the agents' language representations\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in pages 9-10 and Figure 5 of Mudd et al. (2022), there are four different stages that a sender-receiver pair can go through in a language game interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _signal production_: First, the sender randomly chooses a concept and produces the corresponding form given by the sender's language representation (this form is the signal that the sender produces).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _form success_: The receiver finds the form which is closest to the sender's form in the receiver's language representation (by calculating the distance between the sender's form to all forms of the receiver, and choosing the form with the smallest distance). If the concept for that form in the receiver's language representation is the same as the concept that the sender wanted to convey, the pair has achieved _form success_ (by using the _conventional link_ between a concept and a form). If the pair has achieved _form success_, the language game ends here.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _culturally salient features success_: If the pair has _not_ achieved _form success_, the receiver now tries to make use of the _iconic–inferential pathway_ (where a form and concept are linked via the culturally salient features) in order to interpret the sender's signal (see Figure 2 in Mudd et al., 2022). The receiver does this by comparing the sender's form to all sets of culturally salient features in the receiver's language representation (again by calculating the distance and choosing the concept that has the smallest distance to the sender's form). If the concept chosen in this way is the same as the concept that the sender wanted to convey, the pair has achieved _culturally salient features success_, and the game ends here.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. _bit update_: If the pair has achieved neither _form success_ nor _culturally salient features success_, the receiver proceeds by updating the form that they associate with the concept that the sender wanted to convey. The receiver does this by updating one bit of their form which is different from the form of the sender.\n",
    "\n",
    "The five functions below take care of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```language_game()```: Iterates over all agents in the population (sorted by group), assigns them the role of sender, and has them play a language game with a randomly selected other agent from the population. Returns a dictionary that keeps track of how many times the agent pairs in the population reached (i) _form success_, (ii) _culturally salient features success_, or (iii) did a _bit update_\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```language_game_structure()```: Takes a given producer agent and has them play a language game with a randomly selected other agent from the population\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```does_closest_form_match()```: **Corresponds to Step 2 above:** Checks whether the closest form in the receiver's language representation matches the concept that the sender wanted to convey (if so, the agent pair achieves _form success_; see ```language_game_structure()```).\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```does_closest_form_match()```: **Corresponds to Step 3 above:** Checks whether the meaning vector that most closely matches the sender's form in the receiver's language representation matches the concept that the sender wanted to convey (if so, the agent pair achieves _culturally salient features success_; see ```language_game_structure()```).\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```update_comprehender_concept()```: **Corresponds to Step 4 above:** This function is used when the agent pair has achieved neither _form success_ nor _culturally salient features success_ (see ```language_game_structure()```). It takes the form that the receiver associates with the concept that the sender wanted to convey, and changes one bit in that form to make it more similar to the form that the sender associates with that concept."

Remember that these two simulations differ only in one parameter: the number of groups (```n_groups```), which determines which set of culturally salient features an agent has. The plots that are created below show the proportion of language game outcomes (i.e., how often pairs of agents achieved _form success_, _culturally salient features success_ or ended up doing a _bit update_). The resulting plots are shown below the code cell, but also saved as .png files to your current working directory (see lines using ```plt.savefig()``` method below)."

    "In order to run a batch run with 4 different group sizes in a reasonable amount of time, we have to lower the ```n_iterations``` parameter (which determines how many independent simulation runs are run per condition) compared to the original paper. Mudd et al. (2022) used 100 runs per condition. This gives them a solid idea of how much variation there is between independent simulation runs (as some parts of the simulations are probabilistic/stochastic in nature). In the code cell above, I set ```n_iterations``` to 20. With this setting, the batch run below took about 5 minutes to run on my Macbook Pro which has a 2,6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 processor. If the batch run still hasn't finished running after 10 minutes on your computer, consider decreasing the ```n_iterations``` parameter further; for example to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if you want to get a better idea of the variability between runs, and you have some time to wait for the simulations to finish running, you can increase the ```n_iterations``` parameter."
