    "The coding exercises in this take-home assignment make use of code from Computer Lab 1 (which requires the ```tomsup``` package), and code from Computer Lab 4 (which requires an older version of the ```mesa``` package). Specifically, Exercise 3 makes use of code from Computer Lab 1, and Exercises 7 and 9 make use of code from Computer Lab 4. For Exercise 6, you will need to inspect code from Computer Lab 3, but will not actually have to run any code from Computer Lab 3 inside this notebook in order to complete this take-home assignment.\n",
    "If you have previously installed the relevant versions of the packages in a virtual environment for this course in order to be able to do the Computer Lab exercises, you should hopefully be able to run the code in this notebook using the same virtual environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Python version for ```tomsup```:** When installing ```tomsup```, it will automatically install the required version of ```numpy```. However, the required version of ```numpy``` is no longer supported by newer versions of Python. Python version 3.7 has been shown to work (I myself used Python version 3.7.4 to run Computer Lab 1).\n",
    "- **pandas version for ```tomsup```:** The ```tomsup``` package also requires an older version of ```pandas``` to work. We know that version 1.3.5 of ```pandas``` definitely works. (With newer versions of ```pandas```, you might run into an error when using the .compete() method of the AgentGroup class.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mesa version:** The code from Computer Lab 4 requires an older version of the ```mesa``` package. We know that it works with version 0.9.0 of ```mesa```. (With newer versions of ```mesa```, you might run into an error when trying to run the import statement \"from mesa.batchrunner import BatchRunner, FixedBatchRunner\".)\n",
    "- **pandas version for mesa:** The code from Computer Lab 4 also requires an older version of the ```pandas``` package. We know that version 1.3.5 works here as well (same version as for the ```tomsup``` package).

    "\n",
    "**In case you don't manage to get this to run with a local environment on your own machine:** We created a Google Colab version of this notebook which contains a code cell that installs all the required package versions and makes sure the notebook is run in the right version of Python.

Two competing theories of how human categorise things are [Exemplar Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exemplar_theory) and [Prototype Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory). In simple terms, _exemplar-based_ categorisation means: if a novel stimulus is more similar to other dogs I've seen before than to other cats I've seen before, it's probably a dog. While _feature-based_ categorisation means: if the novel stimulus shares a lot of features with the _prototypical_ dog (e.g., it (i) barks, (ii) has four legs, (iii) has a wagging tail), it's probably a dog.\n",

    "\n",
    "This question is about the Mudd et al. (2022) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "- When a pair of interacting agents in the Mudd et al. (2022) model fails to achieve communicative success (i.e., when they achieve _neither_ form success, _nor_ culturally salient features success), the receiver does _bit update_. This process consists of the receiver making their form for the intended concept more similar to the sender's form for that concept.\n",
    "- The Mudd et al. (2022) model also allows for the specification of groups in the population, which determines whether agents share the same culturally-salient features or not (where members of the same group share the same culturally-salient features, but members of different groups do not).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you have empirical evidence that people in real life are more likely to adopt linguistic variants of other people from a group they identify with, than of people from a different group. For example, if you and I are both members of the group \"young people\", and you call something \"lit\" that I used to call \"cool\", I'm more likely to adopt your variant and also start saying \"lit\", than if I identify as a member of the group \"older people\".\n",
    "And now imagine you want to explore what happens to the dynamics of the Mudd et al. model if you add this assumption. That is, under the hypothesis that agents are more likely to adopt the form of another agent within their own group, than of agents from other groups. What would you have to change to the code of Computer Lab 4 to allow you to explore this hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Change the ```language_game_structure_extended()``` function below, such that when the agents fail to communicate successfully, the comprehender agent will do _bit update_ to make their form more similar to the producer's form with 0.8 probability if they are from the same group, and with 0.2 probability if they are from different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Use the code further below (from Section 1.7.2 _\"Below is the code you need for Exercise 7b:\"_ onwards), in order to test whether your new ```language_game_structure_extended()``` function works as intended. To do this, run 20 rounds of interaction between two agents from the same group, and 20 rounds of interaction between agents from two different groups, and print all the relevant information. More specifically: \n",
    "- Add print statements to print all the relevant variables inside your ```language_game_structure_extended()``` function to check that it's working as intended.\n",
    "- Write code in the designated code cell for Exercise 7b to use your new ```language_game_structure_extended()``` function to run (i) 20 interactions between a pair of agents from the same group, and (ii) 20 interactions between a pair of agents from different groups. The final code cell before Section 1.7.2.1 _\"Use the code cell below to do Exercise 7b; building on the code cells above:\"_ shows you how you can create those agents, using the ```ContextAgentSimplified()``` class.\n",
    "- Write out in words in a text cell how you can tell from the printed output that your function is (or at least seems to be, to the extent that you can tell from running 20 interactions per condition) working as intended."

    "\n",
    "_Research question:_ What is more important for successful problem-solving: expertise or diversity?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Explanation of the question:_ Imagine a population in which individuals can develop different strategies for solving a particular problem. For ease of explanation, let's imagine the problem is something practical, and the solution is to design and build a particular tool that consists of different components. Imagine each component has a value that represents how much it contributes to solving the problem, and that an optimal solution to the problem requires a tool that combines several optimal components. Imagine individuals in this populations can have one of two possible strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select one individual from the population who you want to learn from, spend a lot of time to perfectly acquire their solution (i.e., how to make their variant of the tool), and innovate that variant.\n",
    "2. Take in examples from many different individuals in the population, and try to combine their solutions (i.e., their variants of the tool).\n",
    "\n",
    "This research question is getting at a trade-off between accuracy of learning and diversity of input. An important assumption of your model should be that each individual has the same limited amount of time. Spending more time on learning one variant perfectly (as in strategy 1) means that you will be able to reproduce the variant more accurately, and understand better how it works (which should allow you to make more targeted innovations), but it comes at the cost of not being able to see a diverse set of solutions to the problem. Vice versa, taking in examples from different individuals in the population (strategy 2) has as an advantage that you'll be able to take in a diverse set of possible solutions to the problem (which should allow you to combine the good parts of the different solutions), but that comes at the cost of not being able to acquire/reproduce these perfectly (because you can't spend as much time learning about each individual solution).\n",

    "- the environment\n",

    "This question is about the Mudd et al. (2022) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mudd et al. (2022) find that population size has an effect on the degree of lexical variability in the population, where larger populations lead to less lexical variability (i.e., more convergence). Their explanation for this effect is that this is a result of the feedback loop illustrated in Figure 12 in the paper (copy-pasted below):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fig_12](https://github.com/marieke-woensdregt/ABCM_Course_24-25/blob/main/Fig_12_feedback_loop_Mudd_et_al.png?raw=true)\n",

    "<img src=\"Fig_12_feedback_loop_Mudd_et_al.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Mudd et al. (2022) do not show plots with the proportion of language game results to illustrate what this hypothesised feedback loop would look like in a single simulation. So that is what you are going to try and do below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Imagine you run a simulation contrasting a population of 5 agents with a population of 100 agents, and these simulations would behave according to the feedback loop described in Figure 12 of Mudd et al. (2022). Now imagine you would generate plots of the proportion of language game results (similar to Figures 7 and 8 from the Mudd et al. paper) for each of these populations. Describe in words what you think these plots should look like to illustrate the feedback loop. How would you expect the plots for the small and large population to be different? **Explain why**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Now actually run these simulations and generate the corresponding plots with the proportion of language game results, by adapting the final three code cells in this notebook (the first 15 or so code cells below load in all the code from Computer Lab 4 that you need to do run these simulations). Instead of contrasting ```n_groups``` = 1 with ```n_groups``` = 10, your code should contrast ```n_agents = 5``` with  ```n_agents = 100```.\n",
    "Set the ```n_groups``` parameter to ```n_groups = 2``` (for both simulations). \n",
    "It's worth running your simulations a couple of times to check whether the pattern you find is stable.\n",
    "Describe in a text cell whether the results in the plots you generated look like what you had predicted in part a of this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Some of the functions needed to do this run these simulations are already copy-pasted in the code cells for Exercise 7 above. If you haven't worked on Exercise 7 yet, make sure to run the code cells that belong to Exercise 7 to load in those functions before you start working on Exercise 9."
